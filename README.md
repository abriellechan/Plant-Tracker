# My Personal Project
## Plant Tracker - Abrielle Chan

My project is an application that helps a user track data about their plants such as:
- name of the plant
- when it was bought (birthday!)
- how often it should be watered
- what sorts of environments it needs to thrive in (direct sunlight, indirect sunlight etc)

it can be used by anyone who has plants they would like to keep track of, or even people who want to grow plants
and would like to see data about them and what the watering schedule for the plants would look like.

this project is of interest to me because I have grown plants in the past but have had trouble remembering
when they need to be watered, how long it was since I had last watered them, and other important information.
I have tried to write down the info by hand, but I think an application like this would be much more useful and organized :)
